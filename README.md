1. decision tree.py contains the DecisionTree class. We have left most of the methods in this class
for you to implement.
2. get data.py contains the data loading and processing. You do not need to change the contents of this
file.
3. main.py is the entry point for your program. It calls the get data() function and passes the necessary
data to your DecisionTree class
